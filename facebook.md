# HOW TO SET UP A FACEBOOK BOT

1. Set up a facebook [page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/).

2. Go to the Facebook Developer’s Quickstart Page and click “Skip and Create App ID” at the top right. Then create a new Facebook App for your bot and give your app a name, category and contact email.

3. Now you’re in the Messenger settings for your Facebook App. There are a few things in here you’ll need to fill out in order to get your chatbot wired up to the Heroku endpoint we setup earlier.
